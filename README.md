# Hi there, I'm Katelyn! ðŸ‘‹
A passionate software developer who made the exciting transition from preschool teaching to the world of code. My journey started with a deep curiosity for technology, which quickly grew into a strong passion as I immersed myself in the fundamentals of web development. I've developed solid expertise in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and have gained proficiency in powerful frameworks like React. I'm eager to continue exploring new tools and languages that the coding world has to offer.
